Getting Started
===============

Welcome to GDLisp, the Lisp dialect designed to compile to GDScript!
If you're interested in learning how to write GDLisp code, you're in
the right place.

This tutorial is targeted at game developers who use Godot and are
interested in learning about GDLisp. No prior knowledge of Lisp is
assumed. However, I do assume familiarity with the Godot toolchain and
with the scene tree model. If you're a first-time user of Godot, I
recommend starting out with GDScript. The official Godot documentation
has `an excellent tutorial
<https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction/index.html#toc-learn-introduction>`_
for folks new to the engine.
