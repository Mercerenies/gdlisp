What's Next
===========

This has been a whirlwind tour of the basic features of GDLisp. More
comprehensive documentation is also available at :ref:`comprehensive`.

GDLisp is available for use today. I encourage you to try it out in
your next Godot project. You can report any issues you encounter at
our `official Github repository
<https://github.com/Mercerenies/gdlisp/>`_.

Good luck, and happy coding!
