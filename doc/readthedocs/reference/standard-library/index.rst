The GDLisp Standard Library
===========================

The GDLisp standard library is provided at runtime by the
``GDLisp.lisp`` support file. See :ref:`support-file` for details on
how to ensure that your project can access this file at runtime.

All names defined in the GDLisp standard library are available at the
global scope in every GDLisp source file.
